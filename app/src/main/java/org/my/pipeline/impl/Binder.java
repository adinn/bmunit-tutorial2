/**
 * A Binder is a text line processor which searches for occurrences of a specific pattern in
 * each input line and associates the matching text with a binding name, a unique identifier.
 * The binding is recorded in a binding map provided when the binder is created. If the same
 * text is matched more than once then the existing binding is reused. Binding names
 * are created by appending a number to a prefix supplied when the binder is created<p/>
 *
 * The pattern is a regular expression which should contain at most one match group. If it
 * contains no match groups then the whole of the matching text is used as the value to be bound.
 * If it contains one match group then the text for this group is used as the value to be bound.<p/>
 *
 * So, for example, given pattern "the [A-Za-z]+", prefix "DET" and input text "the boy threw the
 * stick at the boy" the bindings would be [ "DET1" -> "the boy", "DET2" -> "the stick" ]. By contrast,
 * with pattern "the \([A-Za-z]+\)" and prefix N the bindings would be [ "N1" -> "boy", "N2" -> "stick" ].
