/**
 * A PatternReplacer is a text line processor which transforms each line of text using a regular
 * expression pattern to match segments of the text, substituting them with a replacement string.<p/>
 *
 * The pattern is a regular expression employing the syntax expected by {@link java.util.regex.Pattern}.
 * This means it can employ bracketed groups to identify elemnts of the input line. So, for example
 * the String "(.*)[Aa]ndrew(.*)" will match the whole line "author: Andrew Dinn, JBoss" binding the first
 * bracketed group to the String "author: " and the second bracketed group to the String " Dinn, JBoss". Note that
 * the indices used to identify match groups start counting at 1.<p/>
 *
 * The replacement text is composed by substituting elements in the format \nn with the corresponding
 * matching text. So, for example the replacement String "\\1Michael\\2" could be used in
 * conjunction with the example pattern provide above to transform the input line into the text
 * "author: Michael Dinn, JBoss".<p/>
 *
 * Note that the replacement String literal requires the backslash character which precedes the matching
 * group index to be escaped with another backslash. A single backslash followed by a digit sequence
 * would be interpreted as a unicode character.<p/>
