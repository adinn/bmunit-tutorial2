/**
 * A BindingReplacer is a text line processor which searches for references to bindings in
 * each input line and replaces each binding with the corresponding bound value.
 * Bindings are looked up in a binding map provided when the binder is created. This map
 * may be populated by a Binder or a BindingInserter running as a prior pipeline stage.<p/>
 *
 * So, for example, given input text "${DET1} threw ${DET2} at ${DET1}" and bindings
 * ["DET1" -> "a boy", "DET2" -> "a stick"] the output text would be "a boy threw a
 * stick at a boy".
