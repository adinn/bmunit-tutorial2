/**
 * A BindingInserter is text line processor similar to {@link Binder}. However, as well as binding
 * matched text to identifiers it also inserts a reference to the binding into the output in place
 * of the matched text.<p/>
 *
 * The pattern and prefix are as expected by {@link Binder}.<p/>
 *
 * So, for example, given pattern "the [A-Za-z]+", prefix "DET" and input text "the boy threw the
 * stick at the boy" the output text would be "${DET1} threw ${DET2} at ${DET1}" and the  * bindings would
 * be ["DET1" -> "the boy", "DET2" -> "the stick"]. By contrast, with pattern "the \([A-Za-z]+\)"
 * and prefix N the output text would be "the ${N1} threw the ${N2} at the ${N1}" and the bindings would be
 * ["N1" -> "boy", "N2" -> "stick"].
